Comment
-------

These scripts basically install NeoVIM and zsh and link the configuration files to your home directory, where the different tools can find them. On Mac it adds curl, tmux and iterm2 because these are not installed per default.

At the moment there are config files for the following tools:

- zsh
- neovim / vim
- tmux

-> if you use a different OS you're free to make pull request for it :)
